# **STATUS** Payload

The **STATUS** QR code is designated to contain information about the vaccination status of the **HOLDER**.

V2 takes the [V1](status.1.md) and adds the option for the **issuer** to add a hash of the [PassKey](passkey.1.md) (more private) or the initials of the Full Name and DoB of the **Holder**

Fields in the **serialization** order:
1. `status`: *Required.* **SHORTNUMERIC**. The vaccination status of the **HOLDER**. Currently designated values are below. Future versions of this specification may designate other values as required.
   * 0: The **HOLDER** has not received any vaccination.
   * 1: The **HOLDER** has started, but not completed, a course of vaccination.
   * 2: The **HOLDER** has completed the full vaccination course.
1. `passkey`: *Optional.* **HASH**. The cryptographic hash of the data in the **Passkey**, as defined by the **Passkey** Specification.
1. `initials`: *Optional.* **HASH**. The initials of the **Holder** in the format of `FLYY`: First name initial + Last Name initial + Last 2 of the Year of birth
1. `photo-url`: *Optional.* **STRING**. The Base32URL version of the URL with a profile picture of the subject. 
1. `photo-hash`: *Optional.* **STRING**. The hash in Base32URL of the byte array of the profile picture.

Although `passkey` and `initials` are optional, issuers must include one of them. 

## Example:

Status with PII becomes: 

```
CRED:STATUS:1:GBCQEIIAWXECNVIUJQXPDV44EW3UHJIGNBGK4ITZAKX37MJNXG6IQZDXS7ZAEIB3ROQ2EWIRYH66FGPJOWBWP3
MK6YTYVGJE332CXM6V2YQOBLHECU:KEYS.PATHCHECK.ORG:1//JD82
```

Status without PII, the original PassKey:

```
CRED:STATUS:1:GBCAEIBFZAH3PHM5YCQHMJ3BTSWP6UDNK443K6GVIJLWEXODVR4RIR3H3EBCAHFQPRC6UBLNGYOLFUN54E7USD
